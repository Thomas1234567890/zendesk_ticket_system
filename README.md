# Zendesk Ticket System

A interview project I was asked to complete.

* 	Connect to the Zendesk API / load local ticket array instead
* 	Request all the tickets for your account / let the user pick tickets tied to a user acount
* 	Display them in a list
* 	Display individual ticket details
* 	Page through tickets when more than 25 are returned / pagnation
